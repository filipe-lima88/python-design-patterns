## Python as Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Check the main principles in OOP:

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods. In Python, 
one don't have keyworkds like 'public' or 'private'. So, the private mode for a class attribute may be obtained using
the '__' prefix. See 'oop/encapsulation.py' code for an example.

### Polymorphism

### Abstraction

### Inheritance

### Composition
