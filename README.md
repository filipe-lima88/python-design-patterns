# Design Patterns in Python
This project is under construction! 

## Python as Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Check the main principles in OOP:

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods. In Python, 
one don't have keyworkds like 'public' or 'private'. So, the private mode for a class attribute can be obtained using
the '__' prefix. 
See [oop/encapsulation.py](https://github.com/victorouttes/python-design-patterns/blob/master/oop/abstraction.py) 
code for an example.

### Polymorphism
A class method that offers different implementations according to input. It can also be when the same interface 
can be used by objects of different types. 
See [oop/polymorphism.py](https://github.com/victorouttes/python-design-patterns/blob/master/oop/polymorphism.py) 
code for examples.

### Abstraction
Abstract the complexity of classes, so that the user does not need to know their internal implementations.
See [oop/abstraction.py](https://github.com/victorouttes/python-design-patterns/blob/master/oop/abstraction.py) 
code for example.

### Inheritance
This is an option for code reuse. Indicates that a class derives some functionality from its parent class.
See [oop/inheritance.py](https://github.com/victorouttes/python-design-patterns/blob/master/oop/inheritance.py) 
code for example.

### Composition
It is a way to combine classes into more complex data structures or implementations without the use of inheritance.
See [oop/composition.py](https://github.com/victorouttes/python-design-patterns/blob/master/oop/composition.py) 
code for example.
